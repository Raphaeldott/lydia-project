This repository is for the Technical test given by Lydia:

Build an app that fetches data from this service :
randomuser.me

Goal of the app:
• Use https://randomuser.me/api/?results=10 to get 10 contacts for each 
api call
• Like most lists, implement infinite scro
• Reload of the list of users should be possible
• The app must handles connectivity issues and displays the complete last 
results received if it can't retrieve one at launch.
• Touching an item on the list should make appear a detail page listing 
every attribute.

Technical implementation constraint:
• The app must be in Swift.
• Any third-party libraries are allowed but the choice must be justifie
• Controllers should be made without storyboard or any xib.
• SwiftUI is not allowed.

As i have never used Swift znd have 0 expérience in mobile app programation
i will estimate the time needed to finish this app:

-Learning and setup (30-50 hours)

-Implementing the app (40 hours)

-Debugging (15 - ...hours)

I will have at most have 20 hours this week for this project so my main objectif
will be to learn really fast about  API and make it to use directly (5 hours),
then make the app usable (15 hours)

It took 10 hours to set swift on windows, in the manual you will find the solution that worked for me.
